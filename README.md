# Todo App
## Built using react `usecontext()` hook and localstorage

This is app made me by following a [yt tutorial](https://youtu.be/6KQeopPE36I?si=94ecEUpX-O-y9qpF)

Making this project, I learned a lot about context hook in react. When i started with this project i have so many doubt's about the context hook but the tutorial explaination is simple and easy to understand.

And yeah my javascript fundamentals are not strong enough, so that the reason i got litte bit difficulty :)
but eventually i made it through!!

Thanks **hitesh** sir for quality content...
